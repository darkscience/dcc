# Darkscience Code Contest
## Rules
The contest submissions will be judged on the basis of the following rules that
are outlined below.

### Language
You can use the programming or scripting language of your choice, provided that
it can be compiled (if necessary) and executed on a 32-bit or 64-bit PC without
too much effort. If you're in doubt please contact one of the organizers of
this contest.

### Evaluation
The first prize will be given to the submission that seems to be the best
submission in general. Apart from this first prize other awards may also be
handed out on aspects such as, but not limited to; originality, featureset and
least amount of code (excluding comments).

### Submission
Submissions are accepted as pull requests. Create a directory with your
username and put your source in there. If this source needs to be compiled
please provide some sort of documentation describing how this should be done.
Pre-compiled executables will not be accepted. As long as the deadline of the
assignment has not passed (i.e. the assignment is in the master branch), you
can make ammendments to your submission and issue a new pull request.

### Libraries
Using third party libraries is not forbidden. You should however realize that
we take into account the amount of effort you put into creating the application
when evaluating your submission.

### Disclaimer
Your submission may be rejected by the organizers of this contest for any
reason. You cannot claim any rights on the work you submit to us, and neither
will we.

### Additional rules
The description under *Current contest* in README.md may pose additional rules
that you have to comply with.
