# Darkscience Code Contest

## Current contest: February 2014 - Image steganography
This DCC will run from February 8th until March 3rd.

Your assignment for this contest is to create an application that is capable of
adding hidden textual messages to images. The application needs to be able to
both encode messages into images and to decode messages from images.

The image should not have any perceivable visual differences after a message
has been added to it. The PNG image filetype is required to be supported. Bonus
awards can be acquired for supporting JPEG images.

Example image and text that need to work will be posted here later on.

Good luck!

## Summary

The Darkscience Code Contest, or DCC for short, is a contest organized by and
for the Darkscience community. The contest is held on a per-month basis. A new
assignment is given each first Monday of the month and submissions are due
before each fourth Monday of the month. Concrete dates will be present in the
Current contest description.

## General rules
Please refer to `RULES.md`.

## Instructions
During a contest, the master branch will contain all the files related to that
assignment. In order to make a submission, do the following:

   - Fork the master branch of the dcc repository
   - In the `solutions` directory, create a directory with your nickname
   - Work on your solution within that directory
   - When finished, create a pull request against the official dcc repository

If you create your pull request before the contest is over and do not violate
any rules, your submission should be accepted by us into the master branch. As
long as the contest is not over yet, you are allowed to make additional changes
and pull requests, although we'd like to ask you to keep these to a minimum.

Once the judging period commences, the contents of the solutions directory are
moved to a new branch created for that assignment. Winners will be made visible
in master until a new contest starts, afterwards this information will be moved
into the according branch for there to stay.
