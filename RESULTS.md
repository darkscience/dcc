## Submissions
### Top 3
#### 1. Fox (Haskell)
Fox's submission is the most extensive one of all. He chose to use Haskell and
wrote a versatile expression parser that can do more than merely calculate a
product from two factors. While it took me some time to examine and understand
his code since I had no prior exposure to Haskell, I could certainly see the
elegance of his solution.

#### 2. Liothen (D)
Liothen sent in two submissions: a ruby one and one in D. Both solutions look
good and show a clean and clear coding style, the one written in D however gets
my vote. Upon seeing this submission I simply fell in love with it, and I will
definately look into the D programming language a little more.

#### 3. NeX (Bash)
This bash submission is the shortest solution that was sent in during this
contest. Nex has done his best to reduce the amount of characters necessary,
and after collaborating with bla came up with this one-liner. Nex did send in a
slightly shorter version as well, but that one did not have human-readable
output.

### Awards
In addition to the top 3 as shown above, I'd like to award the following
submissions below.

#### whoami (Python)
I am awarding this submission for its creativity. The solution whoami sent in
is a small python plugin for his irc bot. It's a very unique submission and
shows how easy it is to extend his bot's functionality. Since the code solves
the challenge perfectly fine, it is a valid and creative solution.

#### d0gpants (Perl)
d0gpants' submission differs from the other submissions as he is the only one
to try and avoid POST requests with incorrect data. Due to the way the
challenge was set up it was possible for the answer to become incorrect by the
time it is sent in. This solution however works around this issue and gives the
user some sort of "warranty".

### Other
The other submissions that were not mentioned here are still all very
interesting and you can see them in the `solutions` folder. I would've
wanted to say something about them all, but I feared that it would draw away
your attention from the winning participants. Again, thank you all for your
submissions.
